        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Coding
                <br/> <br/>
                I am learning Javascript. My goal is to gain the skills to be able to make website templates to sell, create fully realized websites for creatives, and create and sell APIs
            </li>
            <br/>

            <li>Cooking
                <br/> <br/>
                I care about the food I eat and want to become better at whipping up something delicious and nutritious.
            </li>
            <br/>

            <li>Card / video games
                <br/> <br/>
                My favorite card game to play is spades, though I will learn and play almost any card game. Love a good video game. I'm a fan of action RPG, racing, and sometimes turn based strategy and platformer games.
            </li>
            <br/>

            <li>Hiking
                <br/> <br/>
                I love being outside especially on a sunny, warm day. Hiking is a great way to move my body while enjoying nature.
            </li>
            <br/>
            
            <li>Reading
                <br/> <br/>
                There's a lot of gain from reading. Currently I am reading the Way of the Superior Man. More casually, I like to read manga and I'm currently enjoying Vagabond.
            </li>
            <br/>

            <li>Creating music playlists
                <br/> <br/>
                I love music. I used to play instruments growing up. Now, I enjoy music by creating various playlist based on mood or sound. I am regularly looking for new sounds (maybe I should DJ).
            </li>
            <br/>

            <li>Fantasy Football
                <br/> <br/>
                I am the commissioner of two fanatsy football leagues. I enjoy the planning and strategizing of creating a winning team while trash talking the competition.
